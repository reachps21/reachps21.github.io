                    I was born in Cambodia, so my first language is Khmer.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    For me, Khmer is not that hard but most 
                    of my foreigner teacher said that it is hard. I know it, we have the most alphabet (72) in the 
                    world and the alphabet are hard to write too. My second language was English, I use to learn 
                    English for two years when I was small but it didn’t pay off.
                    <br>

                    <img src="images/english.png" alt="english">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I just learn English fluency when I came to Liger. In Liger I have many resources to learn and some of my teachers are fluency in 
                    Spanish.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/spanish.png" alt="spanish">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, I tried learning Spanish for about two months but I just quit because I think 
                    that it is hard for me even though I like the way they speak it. Now, I’m learning Hangul which is 
                    a language that South Korean use.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I got influenced by K-pop because their music was so good 
                    and I want to be like them. I also watch K-drama to improve my Hangul as well. I know all the 
                    alphabet, some words, phrases, numbers, colors. Japanese is also what I just learn as well, it 
                    was because I join an ASE (after school class) about Japanese culture and Max (teacher) also
                    teach some Japanese.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, I learn a lot of languages but most of them are not fluency.
