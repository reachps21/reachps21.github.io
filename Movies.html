                I like watching any movie,(e.g horror, action, drama, romance, comedy )
                Basically, any movie you have for me. Even if you gave a boring documentary, I still like it. 
                Sometimes, I like watching movies alone but other times I like watching it with a friend because 
                we can talk about it after. I know both languages, so I think that it is my advantage for me to 
                watch both Khmer and English stories. I also like watching K-drama, if you don’t know what it 
                means I will explain it to you. It just the drama movie made in South Korea. I watch those 
                because I want to improve my Hangul language (Language use in South Korea) and it is also 
                good too. If you didn’t know that I learn Hangul, go check out it out above. My favorite movies 
                are the huger game (all four), IT (all two), spiderman into the spider-verse, big hero six, 
                Pokemon (all season), spiderman homecoming, spiderman far from home and more. I mean, I like every movie
                I watch
