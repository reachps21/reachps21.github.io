        Hello everyone! My name is <b>Reach</b> and I'm 13 years old. I learn in a school called 
        <b>Liger leadership academy</b>. However, I was born in a province in cambodia called 
        <b>Takeo</b> in 11, july, 2006. My favorite school subject is art,
        It has been one of my favorite things to do. I mosly do digital art, you can click on 
        the link to see some of my art work but I also do portrait art too. Moreover, when I have free time I like to watch 
        movies and dancing. I also like to learn alot of language as well.Besides Khmer and English,
        I learn Spanish, Japanese, Korea. It is fun comparing one language to the other even though
        Iâ€™m not that fluency in those languages. I get influenced easily, so when I heard people speaking
        in another language, I want to learn it too. For me, I havn't really dicided what I want to do when I grow up yet.
        However, I know that anything I will do will help to change my country to be a better place.
